A Rust script preparing to take in APA citations as generated by Google Scholar (or otherwise) and parse them into their parts, in addition to whatever else useful I can get it to do. One idea right now is allowing the input of entire copy-pasted lists of references, to provide an analysis of top journals, authors, keywords, and distribution of years of publications.

Obviously this can be done with the JavaScript inside the component, but it is a good starting task to try in Rust.

Citations can be generated, by Google Scholar at least, with a fair bit of irregularity. Some provide more of an ID number than pages, others lack an article number but provide pages.
