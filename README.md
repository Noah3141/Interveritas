A Rust API intended to take in APA citations as generated by Google Scholar (or otherwise) and parse them into their parts. I plan to use this to allow my React components to take in the pieces as separate attributes, in order to format them differently (e.g. italicize the Journal).

Obviously this can be done with the JavaScript inside the component, but it is a good starting task to try in Rust.

Citations can be generated, by Google Scholar at least, with a fair bit of irregularity. Some provide more of an ID number than pages, others lack an article number but provide pages.
