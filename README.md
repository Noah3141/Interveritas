Tools to make research more systematic, ergonomic, reliable, and interdisciplinary.

Firstly,
This is a Rust API intended to receive, manipulate, and send citation data by JSON, and store citations in a MongoDB database. The hope is, at minimum, to allow mass input of citation lists, and their parsing into parts.

Secondly,
I hope to code this app to scrub citation lists from Google Scholar, allowing instantaneous, organized, thorough collection of a comprehensive list of research on a topic (search prompt).

Thirdly,
Both the former functions can be augmented and hooked up to the database, and lead towards higher level _and_ lower level analyses and organization. OpenAI tools can then be used to fill in various levels of analysis, to produce a fully traversable hierarchy of abstraction of scientific information, internally evaluated for logical consistency, and sorted by evidence quality based on facts-on-the-ground level detail.
